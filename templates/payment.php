				<p class="text-center">Dini, one of the co-founders, has set up 250+ first dates (and 3 weddings so far!). She
					has a secret formula that uses 75+ attributes that have different importance levels, and are attractors +
					repellers to see if two people would be a good match. We use AI to map your answers against these attributes,
					and look for hidden patterns that a human might miss.</p>

				<p class="text-center">But then we make sure that our team of real humans actually reviews the matches. All our
					matchmakers have been trained by Dini, and are people you would want to be friends with in IRL (so you can
					trust them!)</p>

			<div class="how-it-works-step">
				<h2>
					<span>1</span>
					<strong class="custom-text">Talking about what you want</strong> >> Writing random prompts
				</h2>
				<p>
					You don't need try to be funny in your prompts like other apps (which is so annoying tbh). Instead, we ask
					you questions to really get to know you (the real you).

				<h2>
					<span>2</span>
					<strong class="custom-text">Curated profiles</strong> >> Endless swiping
				</h2>
				<p>
					Instead of constantly swiping, your matchmaker uses your answers to send you curated profiles. If someone
					doesn't match your values, vibes and personality - we don't show you that person at all.
				</p>

				<h2>
					<span>3</span>
					<strong class="custom-text">Group chat introductions</strong> >> Opening lines
				</h2>
				<p>
					We're tired of trying to come up with good opening lines, or waiting for someone to text after you have
					matched. With Sitch, if you say yes, and the other person says yes, we create a group chat and introduces
					you, just like a friend would.

								Your trainer tells you how to get in shape, your dietician tells you what to eat, your therapist tells

								concierge. We screen candidates, we check compatibility through values, goals and personality traits, we
								write the opening group chat message. All you have to do is go on the date! (And tell us how it went so
								we can use that to introduce you to even better people!)
