									Your trainer tells you how to get in shape, your dietician tells you what to eat, your therapist tells
									you how to sort through your emotions. But when it comes to love, the hardest and most important thing
									of all, you are supposed to do it all yourself!? Sitch is your dating concierge who helps you figure
									out
									what you want, introduces you to people that you would vibe with, and gives you advice along the way.
									You can't just leave love to chance!

									Other apps make you do all the work yourself - swiping on people, figuring out if you would vibe with
									them through their limited profiles, coming up with good opening lines - and hopefully maybe you will
									get a date out of this that doesn't suck. Sitch does the work for you - we are your own personal
									dating
									concierge. We screen candidates, we check compatibility through values, goals and personality traits,
									we
									write the opening group chat message. All you have to do is go on the date! (And tell us how it went
									so
									we can use that to introduce you to even better people!)

									Think of the hottest person you know, the most interesting person you know, and the most ambitious
									person you know. Assuming that they are all single, they are probably on Sitch. Our members value
									their
									time - and don't want to waste it - on endless swiping, texting, or going on bad dates. They want meet
									people IRL who they actually vibe with, and actually have FUN dating

									We're invite-only. We want to make sure that the people you are getting set up with are people we
									would
									want to get set up with too! So you need to be invited to the app to use it, and then our team (of
									real
									humans) reviews each app to make sure you have the right vibe and background. We also check the
									verification selfie so we know you're not catfishing (or using Facetune too much)

									Nope, our tech + team takes $$ to run! But more importantly finding love is the most important journey
									that we go on, and we believe that paying for Sitch shows that you are serious and committed to
									actually
									meeting people IRL and not just swiping when you are bored.

						</h2>
						<div id="collapseSeven" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqs-accordion">
							<div class="accordion-body">
								<p>
									Our regular tier is priced the same as other premium dating apps. Our founding membership is more
									expensive since there is an actual human who is reviewing all of your matches before you are
									introduced
									to them, to make sure they are actually someone you would vibe with.
