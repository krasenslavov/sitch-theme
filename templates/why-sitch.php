				<p class="text-center">Dini, one of the co-founders, has set up 250+ first dates (and 3 weddings so far!). She
					has a secret formula that uses 75+ attributes that have different importance levels, and are attractors +
					repellers to see if two people would be a good match. We use AI to map your answers against these attributes,
					and look for hidden patterns that a human might miss.</p>

				<p class="text-center">But then we make sure that our team of real humans actually reviews the matches. All our
					matchmakers have been trained by Dini, and are people you would want to be friends with in IRL (so you can
					trust them!)</p>
