								<p><strong>Location:</strong> Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY (Hybrid: 3 days/week

								<p><strong>About Sitch</strong></p>
								<p>Sitch is changing the dating app industry by building a matchmaker
								app powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and human expertise. Unlike
								traditional dating apps designed for endless swiping and dopamine hits,
								we focus on connecting serious people for serious relationships.</p>
								<p>The dating space is dominated by a single company, run by gaming
								executives, who profit from users staying single and glued to their
								screens for the dopamine hit without ever finding love. Sitch is
								different. We're scaling matchmaking with a powerful combination of AI
								and humans.</p>
								<p>We're launched in NYC and plan to expand to 50 cities by the end of
								2024. Join us as we change an industry and build the future of
								relationships.</p>
								<p><strong>About the Founders</strong></p>
								<p>Sitch co-founders <strong>Chad DePue</strong> and <strong>Nandini
								Mullaji</strong> bring experience, passion, and a shared vision for
								transforming online relationship discovery.</p>
								<p>• <strong>Chad DePue</strong>: Chad built and sold a startup, created
								the Whisper app, and served as VP of Engineering at Uniswap. At
								Snapchat, he ran major product areas like Messaging, Bitmoji
								Engineering, Creative Tools, Memories, and Snap Kit. He also led Spam
								and Abuse, served as interim CISO, and is an active angel investor
								through <strong>Uncommon Projects</strong>, with investments in
								Captions, Rainbow, Locket, BeReal, and more. Chad has hired thousands of
								engineers and lead teams of hundreds, but is back to basics, coding
								nearly full time and building the foundation of a scalable platform.</p>
								<p>• <strong>Nandini Mullaji</strong>: A Stanford GSB graduate and
								ex-McKinsey consultant, Nandini was previously at Bumble and built a
								successful dating app. She writes a popular Substack on dating and
								relationships and has personally set up hundreds of couples, including
								three weddings (with more on the way!)</p>
								<p>Chad and Dini are committed to building a new model of finding online
								love and are taking on the major players in the space, because the world
								is tired of endless swiping.</p>
								<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
								<p>We're looking for an <strong>Engineering Lead</strong> who thrives in
								being hands-on, getting into the weeds of day-to-day coding and
								operations inspiring and mentoring a small team of engineers. This is a
								unique opportunity for someone eager to grow their technical leadership
								skills in a fast-paced, early-stage startup environment.</p>
								<p>You'll work closely with our team of 5 engineers, contributing
								directly to the development of our platform while ensuring we scale
								seamlessly.</p>
								<p>Our ideal candidate is someone with a strong technical background who
								sees themself as an entrepreneur down the road. Someone who wants to
								come in and learn how to scale a company and an engineering team, build
								a world-class culture, and build a profitable business with values
								aligned with the day to day work.</p>
								<p>If you're passionate about technology, entrepreneurship, and creating
								real-world impact, this could be a great fit for you.</p>
								<p><strong>What You'll Do</strong></p>
								<p>• Design, develop, and maintain our platform using
								<strong>Python/Django</strong>, <strong>Postgres (pgvector,
								PostGIS)</strong>, <strong>React (Web)</strong>, <strong>Flutter/Dart
								(Client App)</strong>, and <strong>Rust (Chat
								Infrastructure)</strong>.</p>
								<p>• Work on cutting-edge GPT-4 integrations for personalized
								matchmaking.</p>
								<p>• Lead and mentor a team of 5 engineers while staying deeply involved
								in coding and technical problem-solving.</p>
								<p>• Collaborate with the founding team to shape the technical direction
								of the product.</p>
								<p>• Be on-call to ensure high system availability and reliability as we
								scale.</p>
								<p>• Help establish our <strong>Brooklyn office</strong> (launching in
								March) as the hub of innovation.</p>
								<p><strong>What We're Looking For</strong></p>
								<p>• Experience managing and mentoring small teams in a startup or
								similar environment.</p>
								<p>• Hands-on expertise with our tech stack:
								<strong>Python/Django</strong>, <strong>React</strong>,
								<strong>Flutter/Dart</strong>, and <strong>Postgres</strong> (experience
								with <strong>pgvector</strong> and <strong>PostGIS</strong> is a
								plus).</p>
								<p>• A strong desire to stay “hands dirty” with code—this is not a pure
								management role.</p>
								<p>• A passion for entrepreneurship and interest in learning from
								experienced founders at an early-revenue startup.</p>
								<p>• Availability to work <strong>on-site in Brooklyn, NY, 3 days per
								week</strong> (remote otherwise).</p>
								<p>• Enthusiasm for building a product that transforms lives and
								disrupts an entire industry.</p>
								<p><strong>Why Join Sitch?</strong></p>
								<p>• <strong>Impact</strong>: Be part of a mission-driven team reshaping
								how people find love.</p>
								<p>• <strong>Growth</strong>: Work directly with experienced founders to
								gain insights into building and scaling a startup.</p>
								<p>• <strong>Team</strong>: Join a small, talented team of engineers
								building something truly unique.</p>
								<p>• <strong>Compensation</strong>: Competitive salary,
								<strong>meaningful equity</strong>, and comprehensive benefits.</p>
								<p>• <strong>Flexibility</strong>: Enjoy the balance of remote work with
								the collaboration of in-office days.</p>
								<p>Ready to make a real impact? Join us in building the future of
								dating.</p>
								<p><strong>Apply now</strong> to be part of the Sitch story!</p>
